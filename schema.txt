# Notes:
# I need a refresh on one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many construction. Please help me structure this right!
#YardSales.Types: yard sale, potluck, estate sale, open house, farmers' market, etc.
# Notes From Benjamin:
# It's likely unnecessary to have FollowedUserID and FollowedSalesID fields in the FollowedUsers and FollowedSales tables. 
# Because they each represent a unique one-to-one relationship we can set the pairing of the ForeignKey IDs as a the Primary Key.
# There are a few other things that we should probably have a meeting to discuss what the vision of the app is in more detail to 
# determine what sort of functionality we may need to know what more or less we need for this schema.
