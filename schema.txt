(The Pitch instructions say that we shouldn't have more than six tables. If we add location items to the yardsale
table and image to the items table then we get back into an ok range.)
***We could ask the teacher about this, cuz ideally we would have those things on other tables.

Schema:
 - Users (Username, Password, ContactInfoID)
    - Foreign Key ContactInfoID references ContactInfo

 - ContactInfo (ContactInfoID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate, Email, Phone)

 - FollowedUsers (FollowedUserID, Username, FollowedUser)
    - Foreign Key Username references Users
    - Foreign Key FollowedUser references Users

 - FollowedSales (FollowedSalesID, Username, FollowedSale)
    - Foreign Key Username references Users
    - Foreign Key FollowedSale references YardSales

 - YardSales (SaleID, Date, LocationID, Description, Type, startDateTime, endDateTime, status)
    - Foreign Key LocationID references Location

 - Location (LocationID, City, State, Address)

 - Items (ItemID, SaleID, Title, Description, Price)
    - Foreign Key SaleID references YardSales

 - Images (ImageID, SaleID, Url)
    - Foreign Key SaleID references YardSales


# Notes:
# I need a refresh on one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many construction. Please help me structure this right!
#YardSales.Types: yard sale, potluck, estate sale, open house, farmers' market, etc.
#YardSales.Status: scheduled, in progress, canceled, postponed, finished.

# Notes From Benjamin:
# It's likely unnecessary to have FollowedUserID and FollowedSalesID fields in the FollowedUsers and FollowedSales tables.
# Because they each represent a unique one-to-one relationship we can set the pairing of the ForeignKey IDs as a the Primary Key.
# There are a few other things that we should probably have a meeting to discuss what the vision of the app is in more detail to
# determine what sort of functionality we may need to know what more or less we need for this schema.
