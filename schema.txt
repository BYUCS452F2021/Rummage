# Notes:
#YardSales.Types: yard sale, potluck, estate sale, open house, farmers' market, etc.

# Notes From Benjamin:
# It's likely unnecessary to have FollowedUserID and FollowedSalesID fields in the FollowedUsers and FollowedSales tables.
# Because they each represent a unique one-to-one relationship we can set the pairing of the ForeignKey IDs as a the Primary Key.
#^^ Good catch, fixed this. - Nathan

# There are a few other things that we should probably have a meeting to discuss what the vision of the app is in more detail to
# determine what sort of functionality we may need to know what more or less we need for this schema.

# Notes from Caleb:
# I'm not seeing where the Yard sale is linked to the user who posted the sale. That is likely something we will need to look
# up. Currently you can only see what sales a user has followed. I think we could add the UserID to YardSales for looking up this.
