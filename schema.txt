(The Pitch instructions say that we shouldn't have more than six tables. If we add location items to the yardsale
table and image to the items table then we get back into an ok range.)
***We could ask the teacher about this, cuz ideally we would have those things on other tables.

    - Foreign Key Username references Users
    - Foreign Key FollowedUser references Users
