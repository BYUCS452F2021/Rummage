list the servers/machines used:
    - a server (currently run locally. Would upgrade to Amazon cloud)
    - client (android phone)

which relational database software are you using:
    - sqlite3

what implementation languages are using for each part:
    - database server, SQL
    - web server, Java
    - client machine, Android (Java)

what is the nature of the connections between the pieces (bandwidth, latency, protocol, etc.):
    - require bandwidth capable of api calls to our server from a client app
    - via http protocol
    - latency 500ms acceptable. Slower would not break the product, but feels worse.
